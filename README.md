# Computer Architecture and Peripherals Lab Works
This repository contains code for the "Computer Architecture and Peripherals" class, specifically focusing on the implementation of the last two lab works. The code is designed to run on the MKL25Z4 microcontroller board. The main functionality of the code involves controlling LEDs based on touch input. It utilizes GPIO pins for LED control and capacitive touch sensing for user interaction. The code is optimized for performance and readability while maintaining the original functionality.
